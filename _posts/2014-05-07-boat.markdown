##The Beggining

A friend of mine charters out his sail boat most of the year, and has been recieving complaints about the battery.
Being an engineer he purchased a [BMV battery monitor](http://www.victronenergy.com/battery-monitors/bmv-600s%20and%20bmv-602s/) that would allow him to watch the voltage usage to see what is causing
the battery to misbehave. The problem with this is that you have to be on the boat to watch the monitor....not exactly what
a paying customer wants. So he found a blog for [connecting the monitor to a usb](http://jeperez.com/connect-bmv-victron-computer/) 
and an acompanying blog about [recording the monitors data to a remote server](http://jeperez.com/online-monitor-victron-bmv-600s-and-bmv-602s/).
It even comes with its own [Github repo](https://github.com/jepefe/bmvmonitor), excellent.

This is awesome, but my buddy isn't a programming and doesn't really know how to install this stuff, also it requires the 
boat to be connected to the internet at all times...kind of a challenge for a sea farring ships. This is where I get involved.

The Github repo is a great start (don't love how it hosts both the local client with the remote application, but doesn't effet too much)
so I [fork it](https://github.com/otternq/bmvmonitor/tree/dev_file_store) and start refactoring it to allow local storage. So far it now allows storage to a _CSV_
and I'm working on local _Sqlite_ storage. I've also created a [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BMV) package so others can easily install
the software themselves.

##Whats Next?

Now I'm finishing the python package to allow _Sqlite_ storage, then I'll be making a linux service so the script will start
when a computer boots. I will also need to work out an easy way for boat owners to retrieve their data.
